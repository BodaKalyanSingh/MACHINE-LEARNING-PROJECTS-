# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS-
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on. Each project demonstrates the use of different machine learning models and techniques to solve various problems. The projects cover a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, classification, clustering, and more.

Programming Language
Python: All projects are implemented in Python, chosen for its simplicity and powerful libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
Machine Learning Models and Techniques
Regression Models:

Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values by fitting a linear relationship.
Polynomial Regression: Extends linear regression with polynomial relationships.
Ridge and Lasso Regression: Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
Classification Models:

Logistic Regression: For binary classification tasks.
Decision Trees: Tree-based models for both classification and regression.
Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Classifies based on the majority class among neighbors.
Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Clustering Models:

K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into k distinct clusters.
Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters.
DBSCAN: Density-based clustering marking outliers as noise.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality while retaining variance.
t-SNE: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data visualization.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Basic neural network models.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): For image recognition and processing.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): For sequential data like time series.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Captures long-term dependencies in sequences.
Other Techniques:

Ensemble Methods: Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking.
Model Evaluation and Validation: Cross-validation, grid search, and various metrics.
Libraries and Tools
NumPy: Numerical computations and array operations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Building and training neural networks.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
